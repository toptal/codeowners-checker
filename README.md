# Code::Ownership::Checker

This gem checks if the github codeowners are specified to all files changes
between two git revisions.

## Installation

    $ gem install code-ownership-checker

## Usage


    $  code-ownership-checker check

Or via code:

```ruby
Code::Ownership::Checker.check! 'repo-dir', 'HEAD', 'branch-name'
```
### Configure

    $  code-ownership-checker config owner @owner

It will configure `@owner` as a default owner in the config file.

### Check file consistency

To check if your CODEOWNERS file is consistent with your current project you can run
this check.

    $  code-ownership-checker check

It will suggest files that need to be added or removed from the CODEOWNERS file and provides
options to make the necessary changes.

### Filtering Changes in Pull Requests

If you have a Pull Request to review and you just want to check the changes that
are meaningful to you, you can also filter the changes:

    $  code-ownership-checker filter all

It will use the default owner from the configuration if you omit parameters:

    $  code-ownership-checker filter

Or you can filter any owner as a parameter:

    $  code-ownership-checker filter by <owner>

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
